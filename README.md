# Capital One Project

Headstarter Fellowship: Day 1 Project Scenario

## About

Company scenario and project walkthrough, and a 2-min video submission consisting of a powerpoint pitch and coding demo.

## The Ask

1. Create a logging library, remove/identify sensitive items from logs (calling a funciton, passing in a string)
2. Script that runs through existing files

## Information

- What type of information?
- What type of files?

Design an algorithm to be able to identify it. Numbers vs. text, complicated use case scenarios.

## Nuances

Broad statements, our job to ask more questions, DM the admins to gather more requirements/information. Due to its freeflow nature, we should be the ones asking for more information. Taking the prompt and solving it. 

## Inputs

- Creating our own inputs (.txt, .csv, etc.)
- Personally identifiable information: SSN, username, password, list of emails, etc. > Trigger an alert

## Evaluated

This will be evaluated by our peers. Higher the creativity, higher the code quality, higher the grade

## Checklist overview

Soft goals

1. Identify information
[ ] be able to identfy sensitive information from `CSV` file
[ ] emails (contains, is_email?)
[ ] SSN (numbers a certain length XXX-XX-XXX)
[ ] passwords (is_password)

2. Notification template
[ ] be able to notify, create an alert to the person/user
[ ] email them

3. Send email
[ ] notification, *how?*
  
  
Stretch Goals
1. Identifiable info
[ ] phone numbers **Challenging**
[ ] usernames **Challenging**
[ ] Addresses? **Challenging**
2. type of alert
[ ] email *password* has been found
[ ] email *address* has been found
3. ???
[ ] if the email is available, email them at that email
[ ] if the number is available, text them at that number

[ ] IF DATA IS DETECTED, REDACT IT!, if not, ask them to click some link to reset their data or information methinks

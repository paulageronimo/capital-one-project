# Capital One Project

Headstarter Fellowship: Day 1 Project Scenario

## About

Company scenario and project walkthrough, and a 2-min video submission consisting of a powerpoint pitch and coding demo.

## The Ask

1. Create a logging library, remove/identify sensitive items from logs (calling a funciton, passing in a string)
2. Script that runs through existing files


## Information

- What type of information?
- What type of files?


Design an algorithm to be able to identify it. Numbers vs. text, complicated use case scenarios. 

## Nuances

Broad statements, our job to ask more questions, DM the admins to gather more requirements/information. Due to its freeflow nature, we should be the ones asking for more information. Taking the prompt and solving it. 

## Inputs

- Creating our own inputs (.txt, .csv, etc.)
- Personally identifiable information: SSN, username, password, list of emails, etc. > Trigger an alert

## Evaluated

This will be evaluated by our peers. Higher the creativity, higher the code quality, higher the grade

## Checklist overview

[ ] be able to notify, create an alert to the person/user
[ ] email them

[ ] notification, *how?*
  
  
Stretch Goals

3. ???

[ ] if the number is available, text them at that number

[ ] IF DATA IS DETECTED, REDACT IT!, if not, ask them to click some link to reset their data or information methinks
